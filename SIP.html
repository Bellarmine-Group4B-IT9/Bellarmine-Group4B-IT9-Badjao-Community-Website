		<h2 class="">Background And Significance of the Study</h2>				
		<h4>By: Chenikandiyil</h4>

			<b class="SIP"> What is the value of composting to communities and the environment?</b> <br><br>
			<img src="banana-compost.jpg" style="width:300px" height="200px" vspace="10" hspace="20" align="right" border="1px"/>
			Composting benefits both communities and the environment by assisting in the breakdown of organic wastes such as leaves, grass, clippings, 
			and kitchen waste. It includes several essential nutrients for plant growth such as micronutrients (zinc, manganese, iron, boron, etc.), 
			as well as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and is hence commonly used as fertilizer. It also helps to enhance soil by retaining moisture 
			and controlling plant diseases and pests. Composts enhance and balance the soil density through the addition of carbon and other plant 
			nutrients like zinc, manganese, iron and etc. which allows plants to grow stronger roots into the soil, and promotes better growth. 
			The addition of nutrients to the soil by compost increases the growth of fungus and other organisms, which in turn compete with or 
			eliminate nematodes; this improves the general health of plants and reduces their susceptibility to pests. Since compost includes various 
			essential components for plant growth, it also promotes increased agricultural crop yields. Compost can generally help reforestation, 
			wetlands restoration, and habitat revitalization initiatives by enhancing dirty, compacted, and marginal soils.  Composts aids in wetlands restoration by replacing essential organic material, allowing it to absorb up to four times its weight in water. Compost can also help with reforestation efforts by providing as an ideal growing medium for young seedlings. Similarly, compost can aid in the revegetation of  habitats, providing the necessary sustenance for native wildlife populations.
			<br><br>
			<b class="SIP"> How can the specific community or institution your PT group is engaged with, make use or benefit from composting in general, and from your group’s composting project specifically? </b>
			<br><br>
			Our partner institution (BAMAI) can make use or benefit from composting in general by using it to plant plants/trees and make them grow 
			and become healthier, which help solve and mitigate pollution by reducing the carbon dioxide in the air, and releasing cleaner and fresher 
			air. Now, as we know, the BAMAI has its own problems with pollution (specifically garbage pollution), for there is so much garbage that is 
			scattered across the shorelines of the Badjao community (which they take care of), and that is polluting the place. That is why, if BAMAI
			follows the practice of composting, or the concept of our group's composting project (The Effect of Banana Peels on the Height and Number
			of fruits of the Solanum Lycopersicum) in general (the use of banana peels as a compost)l, it will help them combat the pollution that 
			they are experiencing in the shorelines of their Badjao community. This research is not only aiming for the benefit of the partner 
			institution but also a way to resolve pollution in our and everyone's environment as well as an encouragement to plant more healthy trees and plants that also helps resolve deforestation. Other direct benefits of composting to BAMAI if they are unable to plant tomatoes include increased crop yields and increased understanding about nutrient-dense foods. Composting may also assist Badjaos in learning and practicing solid waste management, as well as in making their soil healthy, which they can use to make a living and produce various types of agricultural crops that they can consume and sell to provide the finest lived for themselves, a life with a sustainable income, and food. This research will tell us if it is beneficial for the community and environment; and the additional knowledge about the composting of banana peels.
