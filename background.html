			<b>The problems</b> or pressing issues found in the community/institution are scattered waste and financial problems. According to the partner institution, 
			the wastes in the community are not properly disposed of, and they have been facing financial problems that causes the lack of basic needs because of 
			the pandemic and lockdowns. Their income had been <u>significantly affected by the pandemic,</u> which had an immediate impact on a number of components of the 
			institution, including the ability to provide clean facilities, better education, and health status. These pressing issues needs to be addressed and improved 
			upon to provide the badjao community a better lifestyle and a better environment for kids and adults to grow. We desire to address these current state and problems 
			<u>in order to help the families that extremely needs help in surviving,</u> and as a group, we are capable and willing to help the badjao community for the better. We want 
			to utilize our capableness to help our fellow badjao community achieve a life that they deserve.

			<b>The problem</b> that our <u>proposed project</u> aims to solve are <u>land pollution and financial problems</u> that affected the lives of many people in the Badjao 
			Community through  their way of living and being unable to provide for the necessities of their families. These problems <u>need urgent solutions</u> as 
			these may affect not only the community but also other people living in the nearby areas where Badjao people are scattered and sometimes contributing 
			to the land pollution by their scattered wastes or littering and improper waste segregation. <br><br>
			
			<b>We propose</b>  the following interventions to address the problems 
			and difficulties mentioned above <u>by educating the people of Davao City</u> (possibly even those outside the city) about the institution and the Badjao community's
			current problems (financial issues and environmental issues) and <u>encourage them to assist in any way they can,</u> whether it be through monetary donations, donations 
			of necessities like food and clothing, or other forms of assistance. The people of BAMAI and their Badjao community will also be able to learn and be educated on

			<u>how to use banana peels as compost and benefits of their nutrients</u> to help improve the health or quality of their plants or trees, which will help combat the air 
			pollution brought on by the garbage pollution that has been strewn across their shorelines. We also intend to use our SIP (Science Investigatory Project), 
			which is about using banana peels as a compost to help improve the health of plants, to inspire, educate, and influence them.<br><br>

			<b>The project is significant</b> because it will ease their financial load and reduce pollution in regions that will benefit the ecosystem and wildlife. 
			The issue that our project seeks to address are land/waste pollution, which requires <u>immediate attention</u> because it could have an impact not only on the 
			community but also on those who live nearby; and financial issues that have a negative impact on the lives of many members of the Badjao Community due to
			their way of living and their <u>inability to provide for their families.</u> Our project aids in taking steps to address poverty and other environmental challenges 
			that have a significant negative impact on the community as a whole. The project will further improve their way of life, facilities, surroundings, and living
			which will <u>positively affect their future</u> and help them guide through many problems. With the implementation of our project, we can seek to support those in need 
			as well as provide and assist the Badjao community in improving and providing a comfortable place for families to thrive and prosper. We should take care of the 
			Badjao community as it improves our <u>unity and development</u> in this country; Therefore inviting us to help them and value them.

		<h4>By: Rosalita</h4>				
		<p align="justify">
		<b>We will solve the problems</b> and challenges described above by proposing these following interventions:<br><br> by raising awareness about the institution and the Badjao community
		and their current problems (financial issues and environmental issues) through <u>various ways and activities,</u> to the people of Davao City (possibly even out of the city),
		and we will also encourage them to help in any way they can, may it be through donations of money, donation of basic needs like food and medicine, or to volunteer to help 
		clean the garbage that is scattered across the institution/communities' shorelines. We also plan <u>to use our SIP (Science Investigatory Project)</u> (which is about using Banana 
		Peels as a compost  to help improve the health of plants) to help inspire, teach, and influence the people of BAMAI and their Badjao community on how to use Banana Peels as 
		a compost (or any compost in general) to help improve the health/quality of their plants or trees, which will help combat the pollution in the air, caused by the garbage
		pollution scattered across their shorelines. Additionally, we will also teach BAMAI and their Badjao community on how they could sell their own grown tomatoes, 
		which would give them a source of income/trash and teach them how to start a business and earn money. <br><br>
		
		<b>All of the mentioned solutions</b> are effective because <u>they directly tackle the Partner Institution's problems,</u> and aim to solve them in an effective, 
		efficient, and holy way (no bad actions will be used in solving their problems). Thus, this makes the proposed solutions <u>better than the other alternatives because
		they invite ALL PEOPLE (not just a group) to help solve BAMAI'S problems,</u> and they even teach BAMAI itself and their Badjao community how to solve some of their problems. 
		This makes the solutions an efficient and effective way to solve the problems. It even gives people the chance to develop good values or/and follow God's wishes, which is 
		to help people in need. <br><br>
		
		But, all of these interventions will not put themselves up, no, it will take a lot of <u>hard work, perseverance, responsibility, and discipline</u> from our group to develop/make these 
		solutions or interventions come to life/actually get set up. It will also take the <u>cooperation and willingness</u> of people to participate in these solutions (like volunteering for
		donations and clean ups, or just helping BAMAI in general). That is why our group will try our best, and not stop until BAMAI is helped, and all their problems are treated. <br>
