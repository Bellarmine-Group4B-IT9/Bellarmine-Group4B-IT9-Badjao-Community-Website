			<b>Badjao</b> are known as <u>“Sea Gypsies” or Sea Nomads”.</u> They are an ethnic group found along the shores of Mindanao, Borneo, Celebes and Indonesia. 
			They are recognized for their <u>artistically-woven, colorful sails.</u>
			The Badjaos lived in stilt-houses along the coastlines. Originally they live off the sea by trading and fishing. <br><br>

			<b>Today,</b> the Badjaos have scattered all throughout the country. In Davao City, Badjaos, have been spotted asking for alms along the city’s busy streets. 
			Some of them have engaged in <u>buying and selling of pre-loved and imitation shoes.</u> Some of the Badjao have start to form communities along the shores.
			On of these communities is the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc.<br><br>

			We are attempting to solve the financial problem of the institution by raising awareness about the community to the public about the 
			current financial issues of the institution, by encouraging the people in every place in this world to support, and donate either finances 
			or basic needs like food and water, and by gathering people to volunteer for outreach programs that aims to provide services that the community might not have access to.<br><br> 	

			We will also attempt to solve the scattered waste/pollution problem <u>through our SIP research</u> where composting are used to lessen or 
			mitigate pollution by reducing the carbon dioxide in the air, and releasing cleaner and fresher air.
